                        <p> I am an aspiring Junior Software Developer, originally from Quito, Ecuador. After traveling
                            all over the USA, I found home in Horn Lake, Mississippi. In my free time, I like to listen
                            to programming podcasts,
                            cook for my loved ones, play my instruments, or even just enjoy the company of my furry and
                            scaley pets. I was the ambassador for Desoto County Career Tech West and am currently
                            responsible for an after school program
                            where we will be teaching 5th graders how to code so they can be
                            exposed to the technology field and all it has to offer.</p>

                        <p>I graduated from Horn Lake High School in 2019 and am currently a student at Base Camp
                            Coding. Before Base Camp, I worked as an IT Tech Specialist for Future Electronics at their
                            Memphis Branch. I love to learn so I always seek out ways to further my education. This
                            passion led
                            me to have 2 state
                            certifications. One in Microsoft networking and the other in Comptia Hardware. I also have
                            my National Boards in Computer Hardware Fundamentals.</p>

                            <p>I have to communicate with the people around me on an everyday basis. Especially to
                                ensure a team project getting done on time. I am very comfortable with paired
                                programming and public speaking. I have a large amount of experience in communicating
                                with those in a higher position than me.</p>

                            <p>My strengths include leadership and facilitation. I enjoy helping my companions
                                understand a task they have been given and always will stop what I am doing to ensure my
                                members are successful in completing our task. I ensure I do not overwhelm them with
                                confusing Jargon and make it relatable.</p>
